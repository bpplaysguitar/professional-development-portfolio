## Description

This project was a useful exercise in practicing my CSS skills in order to be able to replicate a design given to me, as I would see in a workplace from a UX designer. It also brings with it the usefulness beyond homework of being a portfolio in which to put my favorite projects as I progress through coding boot camp. For now, I used one of my favorites from my independent studies before boot camp as a placeholder since I am sure my favroite projects are yet to come in the following months and will be added to this portfolio as I go, along with some customizing of colors and styles to make it own.
